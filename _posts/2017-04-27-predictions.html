<p>As part of our work as Contrafabulists, Kin and I have <a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/">launched a project</a> that examines the predictions that are made about the future of technology (our technological future). We'll post <a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/blog/">updates to the project weekly</a>, and as I pay such close attention to the future of education (also as a technological future), there will be lots of WTF statements there.</p>
