<p>A group of friends recently shared some of the worst education-related infographics, and I decided that I should post them to ed-tech.wtf. I&#8217;ve added a new page to the site that I&#8217;ll update as I find new ones. </p>

<p>Attribution gets a bit challenging as &#8211; irony alert! &#8211; folks don&#8217;t always give credit when they share them. (Thankfully, <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2016/06/riding-an-infographic/">Alan Levine did some sleuthing on the image above</a>, finding its origins in <em>21st Century Skills</em>.)</p>

<p>If you have an infographic that you think should appear here or if you have more information about the provenance of these images, <a href="mailto:mail@audreywatters.com">let me know</a>.</p>
